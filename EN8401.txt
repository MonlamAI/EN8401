 Just Friends
 
I know that i don't own you,
and perhaps i never will,
so my anger when you're with her,
I have no right to feel.
 
I know that you don't owe me,
and i shouldn't ask for more;
I shouldn't feel so let down,
all the times when you don't call.
 
What I feel — I shouldn't show you
so when you're around i won’t;
I know I’ve no right to feel it—
but it doesn't mean I don’t.
